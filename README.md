The official currency of the bot is *Flight Tickets* (No, cannot buy actual flight tickets with them sadly, believe me countless have tried)

## Commands 
`.help` gets you the help menu!

`.start` assigns you 5 random cards in the start

`.battle` gets you into the battleground to face an opponent 

`.trade` allows you to swap cards with any interested player

`.claim` gets you 5 flight tickets daily

`.tickets` shows your current flight tickets

`.market` brings you to the marketplace

## Play 
### Battle
To accept a battle request, press Y, y or Yes. To reject the request, press anything else.

In case of a tie, both players' current card attribute is the same, the player who had chosen that attribute wins.

A warrior wins when the opponent has no cards remaining.

You receive 20 flight tickets everytime you defeat your opponent and pride, obviously. 

### Trade 
First the player to do the trade with is chosen and if they accept, then the cards are chosen.

Both players are free to reject the trade at any given moment.

### Claim
To get rewarded for being active.

### Market
The place to get a new card, which costs 100 flight tickets.
